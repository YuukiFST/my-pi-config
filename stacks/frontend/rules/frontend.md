# Frontend design — ordered skill flow (OPT-IN)

**Trigger:** explicit user request only — the user names this file or the frontend pipeline. Once invoked, the flow governs every UI in that task, loaded before the first UI code, not as an afterthought.

**Premise:** one skill alone produces a templated, mediocre front. A magnificent front comes from **running skills in the right order**, each owning one step. Load each skill file *before* writing the matching code, not after. Normally 4–6 skills per front; never fewer than the minimum bar.

**How to load a skill (router-only):** frontend pipeline skills are user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true`) — they do not appear in the skill catalog. Before each step, read the skill file directly: `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` (or `/skill:<name>`). Load only the skill for the current step; do not preload later steps.

**TRIVIAL-FIX EXCEPTION:** a pointed fix of ~10 lines or less inside an existing UI (typo, spacing tweak, broken class, one-prop change) skips the flow — global "judgment over ceremony" applies. Anything that designs or redesigns a component/page runs the full flow.

**HARD EXCEPTION — Design System projects:** if the project already defines its own Design System (tokens, components, style guide set by the user or repo), DO NOT use any skill in this section. Follow the existing Design System exactly. This whole flow applies only to projects with no predefined design language.

**AUTONOMOUS MODE:** the user is NOT in the loop — never pause to ask about design direction, palette, fonts, or layout. Every decision comes from your recommendation, this flow decides (step 1 default = `apple-design`, step 3 fundamentals fill the gaps). Ambiguity is resolved by the skills, not by a question. The deliverable is a finished, verified front the user sees on waking — step 8 evidence (screenshots, clean console, mobile + dark mode pass) replaces user review.

**Redesign of an existing UI:** `redesign-existing-projects` replaces steps 1–2 (audit-first, don't rewrite from scratch, don't migrate frameworks). Do not also run design-taste-frontend's own redesign flow — two audit-first flows fight each other. Continue from step 3.

## The flow — run the steps in this order

### 1. Direction — pick exactly ONE aesthetic (conflict lane)
Aesthetic-direction skills define the visual language and CONFLICT with each other — mixing two visual languages = incoherent UI. Choose by brief; do not combine:

| Brief | Skill |
|---|---|
| Default — no clear signal otherwise | `apple-design` (fluid/physical motion, translucent materials; its motion guidance also feeds step 6) |
| Premium marketing / landing / product page | `high-end-visual-design` |
| Clean editorial, warm monochrome | `minimalist-ui` |
| Raw, mechanical, data-heavy dashboard | `industrial-brutalist-ui` |
| Awwwards-style GSAP editorial motion | `gpt-taste` — ONLY if adding the real GSAP dependency (`@gsap/react` + ScrollTrigger) is acceptable |

### 2. Visual reference (greenfield / high-visual pages only)
Generate design references *before* coding — skip for internal CRUD:
- `imagegen-frontend-web` — one reference image per landing section
- `imagegen-frontend-mobile` — mobile app screens / flows
- `image-to-code` — image-first build: generate the section images, then match them in code (subsumes the imagegen step — use it *instead of*, not after, `imagegen-frontend-web`)
- `brandkit` — only when a brand identity / logo system is needed

### 3. Foundations — tokens BEFORE components (stack lane)
Define the design tokens before building on them; retrofitting palette/type onto finished components is rework:
- `better-colors` — OKLCH palette, contrast, dark-mode tokens (any time you define colors — never framework defaults)
- `better-typography` — font pairing, type scale, line-height (match the project's existing styling system; never introduce a second one)

### 4. Build — pick by UI type
- **Landing / portfolio / marketing site** → `design-taste-frontend` (the skill refuses dashboards, data tables, wizards, editors, native mobile)
- **Product UI** (dashboard, CRUD, forms, app screens) → `impeccable` as build guidance; run its `scripts/context.mjs` first (bootstraps PRODUCT.md/DESIGN.md)
- `better-layout` — spacing scale, grouping, alignment, adaptive structure; read it while laying out a page or section, not after it looks wrong
- `better-writing` — labels, buttons, empty states, error text; UI copy is interface, not filler
- `pick-ui-library` — MANDATORY before adding any frontend dependency or hand-rolling a solved widget (toasts, dialogs/popovers/menus, ⌘K palette, OTP input, charts, drag and drop, virtualization, animated numbers, state, conditional classNames, dark mode). Curated list decides; check `package.json` first and reuse what the project already has instead of churning deps. Task not on the list → say so before picking from general knowledge. Also applies outside this pipeline: any time UI work needs a library, consult it rather than defaulting to habit.

### 5. Component polish (stack lane)
- `better-ui` — shadows, borders, optical alignment, hit areas, press states, micro-interaction values
- `better-accessibility` — semantics/ARIA, focus and keyboard paths, hit areas, forms, reduced motion, 320px width and 200% zoom. Not late-stage polish: these are exactly the escalation triggers step 8's `interface-review` marks HIGH on sight, so pay them here instead of at the gate
- `emil-design-eng` — the invisible-details philosophy; stack it while polishing, it never conflicts with step 1
- **Decorative flourish (opt-in, React only, ONE hero moment per view — never a page of it)** — glowing animated borders or an AI/agent "thinking" loader → `pick-ui-library` §Decorative effects (`border-beam`, `thinking-orbs`; real npm packages, don't hand-roll). Both are React components — skip them on a non-React project (the skill guards this). Restraint first: a flourish earns its place the same way motion does — step 7's shield framing ("should this exist at all?") applies to it too.

### 6. Build-time motion
- `transitions-dev` — the product-motion catalog, 27 snippets (modals, dropdowns, accordions, shimmer, icon swaps, toasts, like buttons, checkboxes, spinning counters, toggles…); run `transitions apply` after components exist. Every snippet ships reduced-motion; don't pull a motion library for what the catalog covers.
- **Install its `_root.css` once** when the first snippet lands — it leads with the shared motion-token scale (`--duration-*`, `--ease-*`, `--distance-*`, `--scale-*`, `--blur-*`). Any *custom* motion written outside the catalog references these tokens from the start (`var(--duration-fast) var(--ease-smooth-out)`), never fresh hardcoded values — one motion grid for the whole front, and step 7's polish pass becomes a confirmation instead of a cleanup.

### 7. Motion sweep — the Emil loop (SEQUENTIAL, after the UI exists)
Restraint first: motion earns its place, and a static answer is a valid outcome. Emil's own flow is `find-animation-opportunities` → `animate` → `review-animations`; the steps below keep `improve-animations` for planning and `transitions-polish` for value tuning around it.

**One-off motion outside a sweep** (user asks to animate one component, no audit needed): go straight to `animate` — it self-gates on frequency and refuses the ones that shouldn't move. Don't run the whole loop for a single transition. `animation-vocabulary` is the reverse-lookup glossary for "what's it called when…" — naming only, never designing.
1. `find-animation-opportunities` — shield framing: "is there anything here that should animate at all?" Scope it per view, not per app, and state usage frequency ("checkout, a few times per session") — frequency changes what deserves motion. Any freshly built page with zero motion gets this pass. Expect rejections; the "Rejected candidates" section is the point.
2. Top suggestion(s) → `improve-animations` — turns them into self-contained implementation plans (read-only; plans land under `plans/`). Don't implement from the sweep directly.
3. Implement the plans — `animate` writes the motion (Emil's construction skill: gate on frequency first, then purpose, tool, properties, curve/duration, interruption, exit; values come from its tables and `RECIPES.md`, never approximated, and it extends the project's existing motion tokens instead of forking them). Step 6 catalog still comes first for anything it already covers (modals, dropdowns, toasts, accordions…); `animate` owns whatever the catalog doesn't. A "no animation" verdict from its frequency gate is a valid outcome — 100+ times/day surfaces don't animate.
4. `transitions-polish` — token-grid tuning pass over ALL motion now in the project (catalog, custom, pre-existing): `transitions review` to audit, then `transitions polish` to apply the accepted lines. This is where motion goes from "works" to "feels expensive": open/close asymmetry (close faster than open; overshoot on entrances only, never bounce a close), hover-out softer/springier than hover-in, stagger totals under ~300ms, dismissals never delayed, every duration/easing/distance matched to its usage token. Mandatory whenever motion was written or touched in this front; it tunes values only, never swaps whole recipes (that's step 6).
5. `review-animations` — diff review of the implemented motion. Manual-only (`disable-model-invocation`); run when the user asks for a motion review.

### 8. Review gate + visual verification (ALWAYS, last)
Static review is not proof. In order:
1. `impeccable` — UI/UX audit before declaring the front done (same `context.mjs` bootstrap as step 4).
2. `react-doctor` — React/Next only: `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --scope changed` (lint, a11y, bundle, architecture; `@latest` self-updates).
3. `interface-review` — the cross-discipline gate over the **change**, not the screen: `/interface-review` (uncommitted + branch by default), or `interface-review quick`, `interface-review pr <n>`, a branch, a ref, a range. It resolves the scope, expands each changed file one hop to the surfaces that render it (two hops for tokens and shared primitives), reads the `-` side of every hunk for removed a11y/focus/motion/text signals, and statuses every finding `Introduced` / `Regression` / `Pre-existing` — then hands the review to `better-interface`, which routes the six domain skills (`better-accessibility`, `better-layout`, `better-writing`, `better-typography`, `better-colors`, `better-ui`), consolidates by root cause and issues one verdict: `Block` (any HIGH) / `Needs changes` / `Approve`.
## Minimum bar per front (never ship a front from one skill)
- **Greenfield visual page:** steps 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 → ~6 skills.
- **Internal / CRUD UI:** steps 1 + 3 + 4 (impeccable) + 8 → 3–4 skills.
- **Redesign:** `redesign-existing-projects` + steps 3–8.
